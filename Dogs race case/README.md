# Part I - Creation, commissioning and coordination of threads.
Review the "concurrent cousins" program (in the folder part1), provided in the package edu.eci.arsw.primefinder. This is a program that calculates the prime numbers between two intervals, distributing their search among independent threads. For now, it has a single thread that seeks cousins ​​between 0 and 30,000,000. Run it, open the operating system process manager, and verify how many cores are used by it.
